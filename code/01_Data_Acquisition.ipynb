    "This notebook launches our project by webscraping National Basketball Association (NBA) player and team data on salary and statistics (total, per-game, and advanced) from various basketball sites. Most of this data will come from popular statistics website ```Basketball-Reference```, while others is also sourced from ```HoopsHype``` and ```Wikipedia```. Additional data from Kaggle datasets may be used at a later time as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using webscraping methods ```BeautifulSoup``` and ```Selenium```, we will start by saving a snapshot of the HTML page housing our desired statistics. We will then use those pages to inspect and pull the tables the interest into CSV's for further data cleaning and feature engineering. You will see that throughout this notebook we incorporate sleep times / rate limits between data pulling requests, this will prevent server overload and potential IP blocking, and will ensure respectful and responsible webscraping. \n",
